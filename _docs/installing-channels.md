# Installing Channels

## Via Wii Shop Channel

At the time of writing this the Wii Shop Channel has not begun development.

## Via The .wii Folder

### Pre-compiled .wca

1. Download a .wca file.
   > Don't know where to find some? Go [here]({{ site.url | append: site.baseurl }}/download).

2. Drag it into the channels folder that is inside the .wii folder.

That's it! It's that simple.

### Compiling a .wca

1. Download the source of the channel.

2. Create a .zip file and drop the source into it.
   > Please make sure that the wii.json file is at the root of the .zip file.

3. Rename the .zip file to a .wca file.

4. Drag it into your .wii/channels folder or distribute it.
